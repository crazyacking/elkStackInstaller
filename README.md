# ELK Stack Installer Script

Since Windows 10 is supposed to integrate a native Bash terminal, this will only include Bash scripts to download the stack and get things spun up for you.

## Instructions
You can copy/paste the script install.sh from here, or you can use:

```
git clone https://github.com/wbuchanan/elkStackInstaller
chmod +x elkStackInstaller/install.sh && sudo elkStackInstaller/install.sh
```
