# ELK Stack Installer Script

Script will be updated shortly to use `homebrew` to build the majority of the Stack for OSX operating systems.  I no longer have access to any Linux based machines, so it may take a while for me to find any easy solution to use for these purposes in the meantime.  

## Instructions
You can copy/paste the script install.sh from here, or you can use:

```
git clone https://github.com/wbuchanan/elkStackInstaller
chmod +x elkStackInstaller/install.sh && sudo elkStackInstaller/install.sh
```

You can find the most up to date information about the ELK stack at : http://www.elastic.co.

To clone the repository (this should make it easier if there are future updates for you to keep things in sync on your system while having some form of version control available)
